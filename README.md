# Maze Creator

This repository contains code for generating mazes programmatically. The code utilizes various algorithms to create maze structures, which can be useful for games, puzzles, or any application that requires maze generation.

## Alogrithm
**Backtracking Algorithm:** 
This code use backtracking algorithm for maze generation to backtrack the current block when there is no neighbouring blocks which are not visited.
